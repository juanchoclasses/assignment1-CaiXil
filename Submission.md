- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?

    About 15 hours.

- Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors?

    Yes, I collaborated with other students, since although I realized that to implement the functions of evaluator I need to use the method related to recursion, but it was hard for me to deal with all cases so I had to ask others for ideas.

- Did you use any external resources?

    No.
